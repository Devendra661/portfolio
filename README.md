## 📊 Project Analysis

This project is a comprehensive showcase of my abilities in modern web development. It serves as a central hub for my professional information, including my resume, projects, and certifications.

The architecture is based on a modular, component-driven approach using React. The site is built with Vite for a fast and efficient development experience. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS and the DaisyUI component library, allowing for a clean, utility-first workflow.

Animations are a key feature of the user experience, implemented with Framer Motion to create engaging and interactive UI elements. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

The portfolio data is managed through JSON files (`projects.json`, `certificates.json`), making it easy to update and maintain the content without altering the codebase.
